      "message": "In my opinion it is most often good to freeze the version used if possible. Couple issues using always the latest available are:\n - if the latest suddenly stops working who shall notice and fix it?\n - it is easier to see what centos version is actually being used\n\nSo I would put here instead: 7.6.1810",

As the DIB is the main tool here I would keep it versioned same way as the docker image so that changes to the product can be controlled.\n\nI would add here the current latest version:\npip install git+https://github.com/openstack/diskimage-builder@2.26.1",
